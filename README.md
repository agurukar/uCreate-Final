uCreate is a website that can be used by UMD students to build their semester class schedules. It is a combination of the current system, Testudo, and a similar schedule builder, CourseOff. The system will allow students to create alternative schedules with various courses and sections that will automatically be uploaded to their account at their designated time of registration. uCreate offers other fucntionalities, such as information on waitlist history and prerequisite classes, to ensure an efficient and user friendly experience.
